Amazon EKS Terraform Deployment
This Terraform project automates the deployment of an Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster on AWS. The infrastructure includes the necessary networking components such as VPC, subnets, and security groups along with the EKS cluster itself.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

AWS Account: You need an AWS account with appropriate permissions to deploy resources.
Terraform: Make sure Terraform is installed on your local machine or VM. You can download it from here and follow the installation instructions.
Git: You need Git installed to clone the repository. You can download it from here and follow the installation instructions.
Clone Repository
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine or VM using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/eks-terraform.git

backend.tf: Configuration for Terraform backend, such as storing the state remotely.
main.tf: Main Terraform configuration file for orchestrating resources.
modules/: Directory containing reusable modules for managing AWS resources.
eks/: Module for creating Amazon EKS cluster.
vpc/: Module for setting up Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) components.
provider.tf: Configuration for the AWS provider.
terraform.tfstate: Terraform state file storing the current state of infrastructure.
terraform.tfstate.backup: Backup of the Terraform state file.
variable.tf: Declaration of input variables used in the project.
Usage
Initialize Terraform: Initialize the project to download necessary providers and modules.

bash
Copy code
terraform init
Plan Infrastructure: Create an execution plan to preview the changes Terraform will make.

bash
Copy code
terraform plan -out=tfplan
Apply Changes: Apply the Terraform configurations to create the EKS cluster and related infrastructure.

bash
Copy code
terraform apply tfplan
Destroy Infrastructure: When no longer needed, destroy the infrastructure to avoid unnecessary costs.

bash
Copy code
terraform destroy
Configuration
backend.tf: Modify the backend configuration according to your preferred backend provider (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
provider.tf: Update AWS provider configuration if necessary, such as specifying AWS region.
variable.tf: Adjust input variables as needed, such as VPC settings, EKS cluster configuration, etc.
